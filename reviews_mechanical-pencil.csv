  Item arrived brand new in original packaging, just like if you were to pick it up at a store. I like that these mechanical pencils are decent quality, but still not too expensive where you would be too upset if you lost it. The lead stays firmly in place and does not wiggle around. The white eraser works well and does not wear out too fast. I like that this package also comes with extra lead and erasers. Only thing, i like my lead sharp and lines precise. Writing with this looks just slightly dull, unless u rotate your pencil around alot. But i think theres smaller size lead for that available, so its just a matter of personal preference.

  The image online shows 3 long erasers, we wanted pencils that took the longer erasers, the package we received today actually has 5 little erasers. It appears the image Amazon.com shows of this package is outdated, the back of this package is also different than the one we received when compared to what is displayed online. Note both online image and package we received today have same BIC Item #'s in top left corner of (41171).

","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",BIC Velocity Mechanical Pencils Surpassed Our Expectations!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
   My teens are more than impressed by the BIC Velocity Mechanical pencils! This is my updated review after giving them some extra time to use them throughout the summer before school starts. My 15 year old very particular daughter has been using them nonstop during summer doing her Advanced Summer English assignment. She’s also been using them to study for Spanish for the upcoming year, and her drivers permit test. She uses the BIC Velocity Mechanical Pencils to make note cards for each subject to study. They have become extremely helpful in encouraging her to be on task. My 13 year old son has had occupational issues and fine motor skill issues all his life. Handwriting has been a struggle for him and much more frustration than fun. He absolutely loves these pencils and has been using them to practice his writing skills. He's been writing short stories at home about things he enjoys or fun things we’ve done over the summer. He has also been using them in Occupational Therapy as well. The vibrant choice of colors excites them as well as the fine darker lead which helps make their writing more crisp and clear. This is especially helpful for my son given his challenges with handwriting. The soft grip is exceptionally helpful for my son and even my daughter, which provides a more comfortable grip. No more need to sharpen a pencil, and refilling lead and erasers is a breeze. The BIC Velocity Mechanical pencils have been a life saver for us! They have helped pull my kids away from their electronics and get their minds back into school ahead of time. My husband and I have even been using these pencils as well, and we are just as impressed as our kids. They are an amazing learning tool for a variety of age ranges! They can help engage children of all ages into writing, and aide in sparking that passion for writing as well. These would be an amazing tool in not only an educational school environment, but also those used to help children learn the skills to succeed in improving their handwriting for school. All of us as a family feel the BIC Velocity Mechanical pencils surpass the average mechanical pencil, and we highly recommend that families give them a try this year during school. Thanks to BIC our family got to try these pencils out for free! Thanks BIC!

  These are budget quality pencils for a budget price. Writing is fine; they give me a smooth dark line. Plastic case looks cheap, but has been reliable so far. The little eraser doesn't last long and the plastic cover over the eraser is a hassle to use. Pentel's Twist-Erase mechanical pencils are much better, but for a higher price.
","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016",Love these mechanical pencils!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love these mechanical pencils since they're easy to hold and just good in general! I've used these for years (they last a long time), but some of mine have broken after a while due to the metal tips no longer coming out properly, making it inconvenient. However, I still come back to these because out of the ones I've used, they're the most comfortable and just convenient to use overall (I know it's quite odd to say so since they're just mechanical pencils, but there's a difference!).

3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What a Amazing Mechanical Pencil from Bic! I was really amazed how well my daughter and I liked these mechanical pencils. She liked that they are darker than a pencil and that it is refillable when she breaks the lead. I like the grip of the rubber holder, it makes my hands feel good and not so tired as I write up charts and allot of them. The colors are easy to spot and find in my purse and my daughter said her backpack, that is a plus since kids lose so many regular pencils. I like that I don't have to buy her a sharpener for her pencil box and she loses allot of those too, it is nice it has a refill in the package with lead and it stores it inside the pencil so when you run out it is there for you to refill. I will say these are the best things that Bic has brought out this year, we will be using these instead of regular pencils. Trying the product for free thanks to BIC, and this is my honest opinion of this product.

  I ordered these for my 2nd grader. They are a good alternative to non mechanical pencils because she doesn't have to sharpen them all the times. I also like that they are medium point. They are dark enough to see her writing and easy to erase as well. It comes with some refills which is a plus!

  You get what you pay for with these. The quality is fine, and it works well, but the pencils are made out of cheap plastic and don't look very nice. However, these are for my 4th grader, so I don't expect them to last too long anyways (which is why I opted for cheaper ones).

3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are my GO TO pencils these days! I absolutely love them. I do not recommend them for husbands or children though. They tend to be too rough with them, pushing too hard when writing and breaking the tips easily. Also pushing too hard on the erasers when erasing will cause the pencil tip to come out too far leading to breaking. BUT I love, love, love these for myself. You always have a sharp tip. No need for sharpening. And when you need to erase you simply slant the pencil so as not to apply too much pressure as explained above.

  I've never really had a need for mechanical pencils until going back to college, but wow these are amazing. They have the barrel feel of a pen with really good pigmentation payout for the lead.

  We, me and my little one loves these BIC velocity mechanical pencils. These pencils are great. They are so pretty in color. They will brighten your day especially the kids at school early in the morning. They are easy to use, easy to refill lead and eraser. The best part of them is there is no sharpening required so they are always ready to use and the kids don't have to be looking for their sharpener like my little usually is. They write nice and soft, glides. My little one use them to draw. They are comfortable in the hand to hold because of the soft grip around the pencils, it's my little ones favorite thing about them. They erase clean if you write light but not if you write deep. These pencils can be used to take test too just like #2 pencils. They are a great product for a trusted brand like BIC. I and my little one had the opportunity to try this product BIC velocity mechanical pencils for free thanks to BIC.

  I am loving these Bic Velocity Mechanical pencils because they are so cool. They write as dark as any regular #2 pencil and they are even better because you are not getting up and running to sharpen it when the led breaks or gets dull. All you need to do is CLICK. It comes with lots of extra led and erasers too WOW. Now you can't beat that anywhere. I think these are perfect for back to school and to use right at home on you favorite puzzle like Sudoku , my favorite. The pencils feel really good in my hand, like they don't feel too big and uncomfortable and they don't feel too small. They are perfect for a older person too that can't really get up and down too sharpen their pencils, just give them a pack of these. I did receive these as a free product from #bzzagent  for testing but opinions are 100% mine. #BicVelocity #Gotitfree

5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The number one problem with this pencil- you cannot buy eraser refills! The pack of pencils comes with a few extra erasers, but once those are gone- you are out of luck, might as well throw the pencils away. I have looked for extra erasers at stores and online; nothing. Also, the eraser has to be removed to refill the lead (instead of the entire top coming off). That means if the eraser has worn all the way down, I have to go hunt down a safety pin or something (to pull the eraser out) in order to put more lead in the pencil. My kids like the grip on the pencils- that is the only positive. If I could buy eraser refills, I would put up with the refilling the lead problem... as it is, I will not buy these pencils again.

We are a family that still reads real hardback books, we significantly limit screen time in favor of board games and drawing, and we even enjoy doing homework together.
